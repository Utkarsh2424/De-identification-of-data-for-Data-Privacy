# De-identification-of-data-for-Data-Privacy
Data is biggest asset for any organization in this century. It defines everything from their 
current marketing strategy to long-term plans. Every consumer deposits valuable pieces of 
their information online. Advances in information technology make the storage, cataloging, 
and use of such information trivial. This project aims to preserve the sensitive information of 
users by applying de-identification algorithms. There are numerous techniques such as 
blurring out, masking facial features such as skin and shape and encrypting passwords. 
Pictures of faces, unlike other body parts, are very easily identifiable. Conventional 
techniques of de-identification aren’t capable of concealing the identity. Thus, there is a 
requirement for masking facial features which help improve data privacy.

Face‐based identification is used in various application scenarios ‐ from identification of a 
person based on still images in passport or identity card to identification based on face 
images captured by a surveillance system without the cooperation of the person. In many 
application scenarios, especially in video surveillance, privacy can be compromised. 
Photographs of the face, unlike those of other body regions, are readily identifiable. 
Traditional methods of facial image de-identification decrease educational quality or fail to 
adequately conceal identity. In the present study, a method that uses blended facial 
composites to de-identify original facial images was developed. This method allows 
significant components of the original face to be visualized while concealing its identity. Due 
to recent advances in multi-sensor acquisition and recording devices and remote surveillance 
systems, there is a need for the research and development of multimodal de-identification 
methods that simultaneously hide, remove or substitute different types of personal identifiers 
(face, gesture, gait) from multimedia content. The solution to the problem of multimodal de-
identification is still a major challenge.
